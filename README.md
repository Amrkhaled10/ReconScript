# ReconScript
This script is for The recon procces While doing bug hunting.
I usually start with it before i manually test the website

Download 
git clone https://github.com/Amrkhaled10/ReconScript.git
cd ReconScript
chmod +x ./recon1.sh
chmod +x ./addHTTPS.sh

USAGE:
./recon1.sh { Main domain url }

and the ./addHTTPS.sh file is for adding { HTTPS:// } before the website if subfinder or assetfinder remove them.
